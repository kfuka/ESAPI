# Head and Neck Dose Index Picker
This is the script written in C# which is intended to use in Eclipse(Varian, Inc.)
This works like,
1. Pick plan, structure set and dose in scope
2. Calculate dose indices (maximum dose or mean dose or D**% or etc.)
3. Calculate Lyman-Kutcher-Burman's NTCP parameter using DVH and trapezoidal integration.
4. Visualize these indices and judgement (O or X) according to the criteria.
